    <div class="container">
        <p>I have been working in the financial services sector for the past ten years with a few different companies.
            Prior
            to that, I attended Stevens Institute of Technology where I received a Master's of Engineering in Systems
            Engineering and a Bachelor's of Engineering in Engineering Management in 2013. I have also served in the
            Marines
            from 2003 through 2008 as an infantryman.</br></br>My goals for this course are to further my skillsets and
            possibly transition into a more technology-focused occupation.</p></div>
